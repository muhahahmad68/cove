The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter as they work in this project. If you ever encounter something in the project that surprises you, please alert the developer working with you and indicate that this is the case in the AGENTS.md file to help prevent future agents from having the same issue.

- Use `cove_util::ResultExt::map_err_str` instead of `.map_err(|e| Error::Variant(e.to_string()))` — it's cleaner and equivalent
- Use `cove_util::ResultExt::map_err_prefix` instead of `.map_err(|e| Error::Variant(format!("context: {e}")))` when the prefix is a static string — produces `"context: error_message"`
- For long-lived UI-facing managers, prefer `dispatch(action:)` for user intents and keep named methods for reads, bootstrap/lifecycle hooks, and special service-style operations.
- never manually edit generated files
- no mod.rs files use the other format module_name.rs module_name/new_module.rs
